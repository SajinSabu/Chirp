# Chirp - Android Messaging App

**ABOUT**

This app uses the starter skeleton project provided by Sinch here: http://tutorial.sinch.com/android-messaging-tutorial/

This app loosely follows the tutorial, for the most part I only used the assets and basic layout from the skeleton. Additionally, Parse is being discontinued so I switched to Firebase instead. I also expanded beyond the Sinch project by adding in Group messaging, completely changing the layout for the app and implementing additional functionality.

This app is created solely to improve knowledge in Android application development and Java programming.

**ROADMAP**

These are the planned features that will be implemented:
- Nearby list will show only users within a range to you
- Group list will show group chats (Sinch only provides maximum 10 users in a group chat so I will probably remove Sinch from this app)
- Attachments to send in chats
- Profile settings
- Additional functionality planned
